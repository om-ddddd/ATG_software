# GUI Composer v3 Component Documentation

This page lists documentation for components that make up GUI Composer.

Components can be visual, data processing or data communication oriented.

- **Visual components** are widgets that can be added to your application to show data or gather inputs from user that will be sent to target device. Examples of these components include text box, button and graph.

- **Data processing components** will take data as input and provide a modified output which can then be connected to a visual widget.

- **Data communication components** are used to manage and configure various data communication options between GUI that runs on the host and target device.


Component detail pages start with a general description followed by an interactive demo which can be used to see how behavior changes based on different properties. The component detail page then continues with properties, events and methods that available on a particular widget.
